# Setup Scripts

Currently not configurable but this will change over time.  
End goal is all files in this directory will just be consumed by various chezmoi scripts.

## Info

Nobara-KDE - [Nobara](https://nobaraproject.org/) is a modified version of Fedora. The KDE aspects of the script should be reusable on other Linux distros using KDE.
